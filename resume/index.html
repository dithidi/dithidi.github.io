                            Since my love of backend development was strong, I decided to switch my focus and joined Abenity as the sole backend developer alongside the CIO. When I arrived, Abenity was in a legacy state with older PHP code and very little object oriented structure. I made a plan to implement Laravel across all of the applications (7 in total) which was a monumental task in and of itself. I became solely responsible for the entire backend codebase and database structure and have implemented everything from payment processing to a custom mailing editor. I have gained extensive experience implementing API integrations with third parties and have become quite adept at devops. During my time here, I have received 2 promotions. The first was when we brought in a junior level backend development whom I would be managing and the second when my workload started morphing into more of an engineering manager which including completely spec&#39;ing out projects and deciding which projects were to be worked on. During my time here, I have been exposed to HTML, CSS/SCSS, Javascript (Vanilla, VueJS), PHP, Laravel, Ruby, C#, devops (linux), MySql/MariaDB and much more.

                            This was a hard lesson in learning to be a fast and efficient programmer. When I first started at ePublishing, I thought I knew what I was doing. The speed at which development moved was lightning fast and I was not familiar with it. I quickly got myself up to speed and thrived in the fast paced environment. I began doing minor bug fixes, change requests and features, but was quickly singled out to head up the new client work where I would be solely responsible for the entire frontend of new client apps and sites. When backend developers were not available, I taught myself backend development and was in love. At ePublishing, I was exposed to HTML, CSS/SCSS, Javascript (ReactJS/Vanilla JS), MySQL and Ruby on Rails.

                            I was able to get brought into a small startup company thanks to my best friend that luckily saw potential in me. I began at RoundingWell as a software quality engineer and began to dive into automated testing. After awhile, I would do small frontend development tasks to get my feet wet and ultimately became a frontend developer which exposed me to writing HTML, CSS/SCSS, SQL and Javascript (backbone/marionette).

                            This was my introduction to the software development world. I had zero professional experience and this company gave me an opportunity to prove myself and to learn and grow as a budding developer. By trade, I was a manual QA tester which involved writing in-depth test cases and was responsible for testing any developer code that was slated to be published. I started shadowing senior engineers and learned the ins and outs of what they did. This was a Microsoft shop so the code was mostly SQL, Visual Basic and C#.
