            <p>I would probably say my web journey started in the Fall of 1997. I would have been a naive 11 year old that had no clue what the internet was for other than using it for research for projects at school. I didn't even own a computer at this point. One day, my father brings a mysterious box home with a label that reads "WebTv" on it. I was stoked. I could finally get on the internet and...do stuff? I had no idea what to look at first. I remember looking at WWE (WWF then) news and comic book stuff...as well as various chatrooms which I undoubtedly abused like an 11 year old would. Funny enough - it was a fantasy wrestling league that I joined that would kick start my life as a software engineer.</p>

            <p>I know what you're thinking. "Fantasy wrestling? Software engineering? What?"...but just hear me out. Back then, fantasy wrestling basically took place via message boards. There would be a - I actually have no idea what to call them. A fantasy wrestling equivalent to a dungeon master I suppose - "wrestling master" that would assign the wrestling matches for that week. Each of the participants (which assumed a wrestling identity - mine was Billy Gunn) would then take turns writing a detailed description of the match along with who won, etc. I was good at it. No...great at it. I could write circles around anyone I came up against which easily won me the matches. But I was hungry for more. I started noticing that some users' posts were styles with colorful text and even images. I had to know how they did that. That's when I was exposed to HTML.</p>

            <p>Long story short - I learned HTML to up my wrestling game. How lame? Very lame. BUT. I know had a skill that I REALLY enjoyed using. I found out that the WebTV came with this website development app that allowed you to create your own website either with a template or with your own markup. So I started creating fan websites for comics and horror movies and just kept building upon my skills from there. After the WebTV days, I learned how to build a custom PC and I never looked back. I moved into Flash/actionscript, Javascript and PHP. I was constantly visiting Newgrounds.com and was creating little "single page applications" using Flash with all the bells and whistles. The internet was so cool back then.</p>

            <p>It has been a long journey, but I feel like I'm finally "on top of my game" when it comes to software development. I'm to a point where I can learn and adapt pretty much anything and have even written my own PHP framework. On any given day I could be writing a VueJS component, doing devops work, setting up applications in AWS, implementing a payment processor or any other random thing. Life is great and the work is amazing.</p>

            <p>Outside of "work" I'm a huge fan of game development and 3D art. I've played around with Unity and Unreal Engine. Mostly just recreating levels from old games I once played like Star Wars Galaxies...but ultimately just to have fun. I have some experience playing around with data science concepts and have been published in national/international journals more than 3 times (ask me about my former, non-dev life sometime). I love horror movies, comic books, sci-fi, woodworking, home renovations and delicious food and coffee.
